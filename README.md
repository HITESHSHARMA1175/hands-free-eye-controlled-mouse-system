# 👁️ AI-Powered Eye-Controlled Mouse (Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe)

A futuristic, hands-free mouse control system powered by **eye movements and blinks** using real-time webcam feed. Designed to enhance accessibility and enable innovative human-computer interaction.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal is to **control the mouse cursor**, **click**, and **scroll** using only eye gestures:

* Move mouse with **right eye iris**
* Click with **left eye blink**
* Scroll up/down with **right eye blink + gaze direction**

This project combines **Computer Vision** and **Automation** to create a smooth, hands-free experience.
